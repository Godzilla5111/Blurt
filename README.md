Wanna post something? It's very simple! Just follow these steps->

## 1. Register for an Account

## 2. Log In

Once your registration details pass all the validation details, your account would be created and you would be regirected to login.

## 3. Create Post

Once you have logged in succesfully, you will be able to create posts. Creating a post is easy peasy. Head over to 'New Post' section in the navbar.

## 4. Post the Post

After you are satisfied with the post content, press the 'Post' button to post it and make it  visible to the entire world.

So this was the step by step procedure for posting something. But let's say, you want to make changes in your post content or delete a post. How to do it? Again, it's very simple. You just have to head over to the specific page of the post(which can be accessed by clicking on the title of the post in the home page). If the post has been originally composed by you and you are still logged in, you will see two buttons, with options to 'Update' or 'Delete' the post! That's it!

Apart from this, you can head over to 'Account' section where you can make changes to your account details. You can change your username, registered email address or upload a profile picture, whatever you wish! In the example below, I have changed the profile-pic for the test user.

Having trouble signing in? Forgot your password? Don't worry! You can tap on 'Forgot Password' and provide your registered email-id. You will recieve a 'Rest Password' link in your mailbox within a minute. Please make sure to check the spam and promotions folder in case it doesnot appear in the inbox.

Other than viewing your own account, clicking on someone else's account name will take you to their page, where only posts written by that specific person will be listed.
